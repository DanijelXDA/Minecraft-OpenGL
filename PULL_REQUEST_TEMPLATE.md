By default, pull requests are based on the parent repository's default branch.

If the default parent repository isn't correct, you can change both the parent repository and the branch with the drop-down lists. You can also swap your head and base branches with the drop-down lists to establish diffs between reference points. References here must be branch names in your GitHub repository.

Pull Request editing branches

When thinking about branches, remember that the base branch is where changes should be applied, the head branch contains what you would like to be applied.

When you change the base repository, you also change notifications for the pull request. Everyone that can push to the base repository will receive an email notification and see the new pull request in their dashboard the next time they sign in.

When you change any of the information in the branch range, the Commit and Files changed preview areas will update to show your new range.

Tips:

Using the compare view, you can set up comparisons across any timeframe. For more information, see "Comparing commits across time."
Project maintainers can add a pull request template for a repository. Templates include prompts for information in the body of a pull request. For more information, see "About issue and pull request templates."
